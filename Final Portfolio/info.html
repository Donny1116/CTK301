  <p class="style">My name is Donovan Anderson!!!</p>

  <p class="style">I am a graduate of RichTonship Highschool and I currently attend Illinois State University.</p>

  <p class="style">My major is in Creative Technologies under the Game Desgin pathway. I also have a minor in computer science. With these two combined, I hope to be able to obtain a wide catalog of knowledge and skills that make me standout compared to other in the ever growing technology field. </p>

  <p class="style">Prior to college and even highschool, I already had a small amount of experience when it came to coding and even Game Design. My mom enrolled me in a 3-week game design course that taught me the basics of creating games and how the coding process works. Experiencing this at a young age is the main reason why I love technology now and why I have a passion for learning about tech.</p>

  <p class="style">In the future, I hope to be working for a major tech or game company that aligns with my interest, where I will not only be able to make a living, but also enjoy what I am doing. I also want to give back to communities that don't have access to the resources that I had as a kid. In some places, children don't have access to computers or technology in general, so I would love to be able to give this type of exposure to people that have an interest in but can't afford to.</p>
